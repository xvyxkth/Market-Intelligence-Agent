        "title": "Couple's move to St. Louis Hills brings grandkids closer",
        "body": "Pat Eby Special to the Post-Dispatch\n\nWhen Jan and Bob Wacker packed up and moved from their home in St. Louis County it's because family comes first with them. They chose their current house in St. Louis Hills to be closer to their children and seven grandchildren. \"They all live within a mile and a half of our house,\" Jan says.\n\nFor Jan, the July 2023 move brought her back to her roots. Her dad worked as an architect and draftsman for Cyrus Crane Willmore, a prominent St. Louis developer, who specialized in developing high-end home districts. In 1929, he purchased the last undeveloped 700-acre land tract in St. Louis, which would become St. Louis Hills. He also donated 70 acres to the city for a park, which now bears his name.\n\nBob has history with another strong city neighborhood. His mother and father met while they were students at St. Louis University. His dad was a physician, mom was a nurse. After graduation the couple moved to California, his dad's home state. Bob was born in California, but with another child on the way, the family moved back to the Hill, where his mom was raised. The family lived on the Hill with his maternal grandmother for a year or so before they moved out to Shrewsbury, and then to Crestwood, where they stayed.\n\nPope Leo XIV in St. Louis: 'Bob' Prevost started his papal journey here Ex-St. Louis mayor Tishaura Jones blasts voters for turning on Black women In win for Josh Hawley, Trump names four to long-vacant federal judgeships in St. Louis Boy shot, killed near Ferguson was a football star.

Then there's the Blues losing a Game 7 lead with 2.2 seconds left. Missouri veteran was missing for years.

'Something wasn't right.' Blues' Dylan Holloway, Tyler Tucker were out for season; GM thinks Torey Krug done playing\n\nCity living agrees with both of them. \"Beyond being close to the kids and grandkids, we live in a nice walkable area. Francis Park is just two blocks away. a vibrant, friendly neighborhood,\" Bob says.\n\n\"We also love that we can get in a golf cart and go to one of the good restaurants nearby. On Thursday nights we can shop at the farmers and family market in Francis Park then stop in at the Rockwell beer garden if we like,\" she says. \"The kids and grandkids often join us there.\"\n\nTheir 94-year-old house, built in 1931, wasn't move-in ready, but the Wackers brushed it up, fixed what needed to be done, and made a plan. They added a 900-square-foot addition that included a first-floor suite with a laundry closet. The remodeled house now has four bedrooms, two and a half baths, a new deck, back patio, and an open floor plan family room, dining room and kitchen.\n\nThey redesign allows for a good flow of space for entertaining guests. Their thoughtful changes will allow them both to age in place comfortably with no need to go up or down steps. They also allowed for fun and relaxation.\n\nThey kept the hardwood floors and refinished them in the original part of the home. In the new addition they put installed easy-to-care for laminate flooring.\n\nThe fireplace original to the house wasn't working, so they added a new fireplace in their front room, which looks out to the street. It's a favorite room for them both and the place where Bob most often enjoys a good book. A big window in the original house made the perfect space for a handsome built-in display and bookcase in the dining room.\n\nThey purchased the artworks in the house over years of travel, buying pieces from local artists at each place they visit. Not all of it is installed yet in the new home, but they especially like three bridge paintings they bought in Venice. They even met the artist, who was painting on the bridge. Each piece has a personal meaning for them.\n\nJan enjoys cooking and baking for special occasions, so the revamped kitchen fits that bill. Bob now has a wet bar adjacent to the kitchen with space above for his Scotch collection. They converted an odd space off the kitchen into a wine room where they can relax and listen to music.\n\nBecause Jan loves bright flowers and gardening, a changed-up outdoor space was in order so she could work her colorful magic in a new garden. They did a complete landscaping job including sidewalks, a new patio and deck, and plantings. Their next project in the fall will be to tackle the basement.\n\nThey're considering another city lifestyle change. \"We are finding people here tend to entertain in their front yard as well. We don't have a big patio in the front yet, but we'll see,\" Jan says.\n\nThe move to the city has changed up life for two grandparents who want the very best for their grandchildren. The kids can walk over to visit them. Bob and Jan are regulars at their sports events and school programs. \"A few weekends back we had two of the grandchildren stay here for four nights while their parents were out of town,\" Jan says. \"The neat part is that we can just walk them to school, then pick them up from school and walk back. That's really special.\"\n\n0 Comments",

        "body": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- When Florida state Rep. Fiona McFarland's infant daughter, Grace Melton, crawled for the first time, the mom of four was right next door, hard at work with her legislative policy staff in the state Capitol.\n\nThanks to the on-site child care available in the statehouse, McFarland didn't miss that magical first milestone in her now 7-month-old's young life.\n\n\"The sitter I had with her just grabbed me out of my meeting right next door and I came over and got to witness it,\" McFarland recalled.\n\nAs more women and young people run for public office, they bring more than fresh policy ideas to statehouses -- some bring their kids.\n\nLike other working parents across the country, some lawmakers scramble to find child care that fits their often unpredictable schedules, at a price they can afford. Rushing back and forth from their districts, they juggle meetings with constituents and coordinate their children's drop-offs, power through late-night floor sessions and step out to pump breast milk between votes, hoping to make it home for their kids' bedtime.\n\nPope Leo XIV in St. Louis: 'Bob' Prevost started his papal journey here Ex-St. Louis mayor Tishaura Jones blasts voters for turning on Black women In win for Josh Hawley, Trump names four to long-vacant federal judgeships in St. Louis Boy shot, killed near Ferguson was a football star.

'Something wasn't right.' Blues' Dylan Holloway, Tyler Tucker were out for season; GM thinks Torey Krug done playing\n\n\"Looking back, I'm like, 'How did I do that?'\" Michigan state Sen. Stephanie Chang said, recalling those frenzied years when she was a new legislator and a new mom.\n\nThe Democrat used to race across the state with her baby and freezer bags of milk in tow, leaving her daughter with family members so she could make her 9 a.m. committee meetings at the state Capitol in Lansing.\n\nIn one of the few industrialized countries that lacks universal paid family leave, Chang says America's child care crunch is keeping some parents from running for public office because they simply \"cannot make it all work,\" leaving young families with fewer advocates to help decide \"what we're doing for the future of our children.\"\n\nAs more young parents get elected, advocates push for more support\n\nSome state capitols, mostly built before women could vote, still lack enough accessible bathrooms, advocates say, let alone spaces to comfortably change a baby's diaper or nurse an infant.\n\n\"Legislators legislate based on their lived experience,\" said Liuba Grechen Shirley, founder of the Vote Mama Foundation, which pushes to break barriers that moms face while running for office.\n\n\"We have terrible policies that fail women and children across the country because we don't have enough moms serving at any level of government,\" she said.\n\nAs of this year, 33% of state legislators were women, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Fewer than 8% of those lawmakers are moms of minor children, a Vote Mama analysis found.\n\nStatehouses' child care offerings largely lag behind other workplaces, but advocates say they're gaining some ground.\n\nThe Virginia House of Delegates now gives a child care stipend to members with young kids to help cover their expenses during session.\n\nAt least two-thirds of states allow candidates of any gender running for public office to use campaign funds to pay for child care expenses after the Federal Elections Commission approved the practice for federal candidates in 2018.\n\nA child care space just for Florida lawmakers\n\nIn Florida's Capitol, amid the chattering of lobbyists and clicking of high heels, the voices of children like Grace can be heard as they play inside two on-site child care spaces created just for kids of legislators.\n\nMcFarland, whose four children are ages 5 and under, was elected for the first time in 2020, the year she also gave birth to her first child. Since then, her public service was fueled by \"caffeine and dry shampoo,\" she joked.\n\nOn early mornings before the Capitol's in-house day care opens up, McFarland plops Grace into a bouncy chair on her desk in her legislative office, or holds the baby with one hand as she flips through briefing books.\n\n\"Moms will always make it work,\" the Republican said.\n\nWhile the House is in session or committee hearings are in swing, McFarland can drop off her daughter at the child care upstairs. It's not open every day and the hours vary, McFarland says.\n\nThe staff working in the Capitol's child care are paid out of campaign funds, spokespeople for the House speaker and Senate president said. The initiative grew out of the Legislature's program for lawmakers' spouses, many of whom travel to Tallahassee for session.\n\nAfter the day care closes for the afternoon, Grace comes back downstairs to nap and play in a nursery McFarland set up in the room next to her office. McFarland also hires sitters to take care of her baby when the child care space isn't open, a cost she pays herself.\n\nEvery working parent has to make trade-offs, McFarland said, but having child care in the Capitol means she doesn't have to make quite as many.\n\nFlorida's Capitol child care is an \"informal\" approach, but could serve as a model for legislatures across the country, Grechen Shirley said.\n\nIt's a \"first step\" she said, that states should bolster with other policies like allowing proxy voting, paying lawmakers a \"livable wage\" and letting candidates use campaign funds to cover child care expenses.\n\n\"If we want a legislature that actually reflects our society,\" she said, \"we have to make it easier for young families to run for office and to stay in office.\"\n\n0 Comments",

        "title": "The Bananas We Eat Every Day Might Be Going Extinct  --  A Biologist Highlights An Impending Disaster",
        "body": "Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.\n\nBananas are one of the most beloved fruits on the planet, gracing breakfast tables, smoothies and lunch boxes alike. Yet their ubiquity masks a fragile reality: Nearly all the bananas we eat today descend from a single genetic lineage, making them astonishingly uniform and, so, highly vulnerable to disease.\n\nThis lack of diversity isn't a coincidence but the result of centuries of human cultivation practices that favor consistency over resilience. The prospect of a \"banana apocalypse\" arises from the specter of a soil-borne fungus -- Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Tropical Race 4 (TR4) -- that already threatens plantations from Asia to Latin America.\n\nBecause banana plants are propagated asexually via rhizome cuttings rather than seeds, entire plantations can be wiped out in a single outbreak, with no genetic bulwark to slow or prevent the pathogen's advance.\n\nHistory offers a stark warning: In the mid-20th century, the once-dominant Gros Michel cultivar was decimated by Panama disease, forcing the global industry to switch almost exclusively to the Cavendish.\n\nYet, the Cavendish itself, a sterile clone prized for its shipping qualities, now faces the same fate that doomed its predecessor. Unless we diversify and develop truly resistant varieties, we may soon witness history repeating itself -- only on a much larger, more devastating scale.\n\nBanana plants do not reproduce sexually in commercial settings; instead, farmers propagate them by planting offshoots -- clonal \"pups\" that are genetically identical to the parent tree. The method ensures uniform fruit size, taste and ripening time, essential for a global export market that demands consistency.\n\nHowever, this means that every banana in a plantation is essentially a carbon copy of its neighbors, sharing the same vulnerabilities and none of the genetic variation that might offer resistance to natural disease.\n\nMoreover, bananas have an odd genetic makeup: they are triploids, with three sets of chromosomes, making them inherently sterile. While this eliminates seeds and yields the convenient, seedless bananas that consumers love, it also means breeders cannot cross different varieties to introduce new disease-resistant traits using traditional methods.\n\nAs a result, when a pathogen like TR4 finds an opening, it can spread like wildfire through an entire plantation, overwhelming every genetically identical plant in its path.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Gros Michel cultivar -- nicknamed \"Big Mike\" -- reigned supreme in the global banana trade, celebrated for its rich flavor, sturdy peel and long shelf life. Once, it dominated export markets from Central America to Europe and North America, plantations relied almost entirely on Gros Michel rip-offs propagated by clonal offshoots.\n\nHowever, in the 1950s, Panama disease -- caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Tropical Race 1 -- began ravaging across Gros Michel farms in Costa Rica, Panama and beyond.\n\nBecause Gros Michel plants shared the same genetic weaknesses, the fungus spread unchecked, killing plantations by the thousands of hectares and collapsing entire local economies.\n\nBy 1960, Gros Michel exports had all but vanished from supermarket shelves; surviving plants only persisted in isolated, small-scale farms or private collections of wealthy aficionados who could afford the costly biosecurity measures necessary to keep them alive.\n\nThe industry's overreliance on a single variety had laid bare the peril of monoculture and monoclonality.\n\nIn response to Gros Michel's collapse, the industry pivoted to the Cavendish subgroup, which proved naturally resistant to Tropical Race 1. The Cavendish's smooth, firm fruit and sturdy skin made it ideal for export, and by the 1970s, it had effectively monopolized the banana trade -- accounting for roughly 99% of exported bananas.\n\nThis success has set the stage for the next crisis, primarily because, like Gros Michel, Cavendish bananas are also clones propagated whole from a narrow genetic base.\n\nStarting in the late 20th century, TR4 emerged in Southeast Asia and has since spread to at least 21 banana-producing countries, including plantations in Australia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.\n\nNearly all commercial Cavendish clones are susceptible to TR4. Globally, it is estimated that 80 percent of banana production, equivalent to billions of servings, is under threat from TR4 and there are currently no commercially viable resistant replacements ready for large-scale planting.\n\nEfforts to breed or engineer resistance -- such as Australia's GM QCAV-4 banana or Chiquita's Yelloway 1 strain -- offer hope but currently face regulatory hurdles and public skepticism and are hindered by the slow development pace compared to the fungus's rapid spread.\n\nWithout decisive action -- diversifying plantations with multiple cultivars, investing in robust breeding programs and adopting robust biosecurity -- the global banana supply may again teeter on the brink of collapse.\n\nFor consumers accustomed to the ever-present yellow fruit, the banana apocalypse may sound like science fiction, but history and science tell a more sobering story: we have seen this movie before and the sequel is almost always worse.",
