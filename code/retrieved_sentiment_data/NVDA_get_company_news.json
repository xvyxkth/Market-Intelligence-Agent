        "title": "Nvidia Stock At 40% Safety",
        "body": "Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.\n\nAt about $117 a share, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still trading about 15% below its all-time highs seen in January 2025. Revenues grew more than 110% over the last year, while net profit margins exceeded 50%. With artificial intelligence tunes playing everywhere, do you think Nvidia stock is a good long-term bet at current levels? What about at a 30% discount at about $82 per share? Now we're talking. So if you think $82 per share for the AI poster-child is a steal, and have some cash ready to go, here's a clever trade.\n\nThe Trade: 12% yield at 30% margin of safety, by selling Put Options\n\nThink that's too risky? Want a higher margin of safety - for example 40%? Use a $70 strike instead of $82 strike - your overall earnings will still be an impressive 9% instead of 12%, and you'll enjoy more peace. The strategy is reliable because large institutions have tested the strategy at scale, and for the right long-term investors, may serve just right. As an aside, market leadership is in fact one of the factors we consider in constructing the market-beating Trefis High Quality portfolio (HQ) - a strategy of 30 stocks that targets long-term value creation. HQ has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception.\n\nSure, I see the 12% return, however, what if Nvidia drops more than 30%, isn't there some risk?\n\nOf course, there is risk. Because, there are two ways this could unfold:\n\nIn short, you win either way, especially if you're comfortable owning a quality company like Nvidia for the long haul.\n\nIf you do end up owning NVDA stock, you're not stuck with some speculative small-cap stock. You're holding a company that is:\n\nAnd The Risk of a Crash Is Lower Than You Think\n\nSelling puts is only as good as the business you're willing to own. With Nvidia, that bar is high. Here's why:\n\nThese are the kinds of margin-of-safety setups and asymmetric risk-reward tradeoffs that we seek in the Trefis HQ portfolio, which is focused on long-term value creation. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.",

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now | The Motley Fool",
        "body": "Many investors are watching large tech companies invest massive capital into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. The big question is when, or even if, there will be an adequate return on those investments.\n\nThere are even concerns that massive capital allocation plans already announced may be cut or pushed out. But there are more and more signs that spending is continuing and even accelerating. If that indeed remains true, two of the biggest beneficiaries of that spending are no-brainer stocks to buy right now.\n\nCurrently, one of the main recipients of that capital is Nvidia (NVDA -0.62%). Its high-end chips are filling server stacks in many data centers being built globally. As a result, the AI boom has been of game-changing benefit to Nvidia and its investors. The stock has been under pressure, though, as questions surface about demand from a slowdown in AI infrastructure spending, and regulatory headwinds in the form of export restrictions.\n\nThe concerns related to capital spending may be overblown. Jonathan Gray, chief operating officer of asset manager Blackstone, recently told CNBC: \"I think this trend is powerful. I think it will continue...overall, we still see a ton of demand.\" That's great news for Nvidia investors and supports what large Nvidia customers like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Amazon have been saying about maintaining, or even growing, their capital spending plans.\n\nExport curbs could be more problematic for Nvidia. Management already said Nvidia plans to take $5.5 billion in charges after the Trump administration declared limits to exports and required licensing for Nvidia's H20 AI chip sales to China. That chip was a modified product created specifically to comply with previous regulations for China shipments.\n\nChina is an important market for Nvidia. Concerns surrounding that business are a big reason why Nvidia shares have declined this year. Sales there represented 13% of total revenue last year. That was down from 17% in the prior fiscal year, though, showing that Nvidia isn't overly reliant on Chinese customers.\n\nRecent reports say that President Donald Trump may even be ready to relax AI chip export curbs, too. Just as Biden-era export restrictions are getting ready to go into effect, Trump reportedly will overturn those rules. Potential rules and regulations going forward remain unclear, but the effect on Nvidia's business may already be priced into the stock.\n\nThe takeaway is that investing in the AI leader should still make sense, especially as the stock has pulled back this year. With Nvidia's business still flourishing, investors could also look to its biggest supplier for a winning investment right now.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (TSM 0.87%) also considers Nvidia one of its most important customers. TSMC supplies semiconductor products, including microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), microcontrollers, and other specialty and advanced technology packages. Nvidia is one of several big tech companies reliant on TSMC, but the Taiwan-based company has a diverse customer base. It supplied products to more than 500 customers last year.\n\nDemand for its services is surging. Revenue soared 42% in the first quarter, and profits surged even more. Net income and diluted EPS (earnings per share) soared 60% year over year. That rapid growth is expected to continue. Management expects year-over-year revenue to jump another nearly 40% in the current quarter.\n\nYet, as with Nvidia, investors have pushed TSMC shares down by more than 10% year to date. That's led to a very desirable valuation. The stock now trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 20.\n\nNvidia and TSMC stocks have both been beaten down due to concerns about slowing growth. Yet based on customer demand and tech companies' recent comments, the rise in AI development has not become a bubble. Even if capital spending on data center buildouts does slow, that doesn't present the full picture either. AI also includes software that is likely going to run in almost every device for both consumers and many enterprises.\n\nTaking that broader view should make most investors comfortable owning both Nvidia and TSMC at recent valuations.",

        "body": "Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) remains the most widely held semiconductor stock among U.S. active fund managers, according to April data from BofA Securities. The chipmaker was included in 73% of fund portfolios, marking a 67-basis-point increase from the prior quarter and a 518-point rise year over year. However, Nvidia's relative weighting stood at just 1.05x its share of the S&P 500 -- below the 1.11x median for top tech and communication stocks.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) saw the biggest quarterly surge in ownership, rising 875 basis points to 64.6%. Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) followed with 30.8%, though it posted a 417-point decline. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) dropped sharply to 28.9%, down over 1,200 basis points. Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS) and Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX) rounded out the top six with 25.3% and 24.8% ownership, respectively.\n\nOverall, semiconductor stocks were underweight in portfolios, with sector-wide relative weighting falling to 0.90x in April from 1.01x in December. Notably, Synopsys was the most overweight at 1.71x, followed by Broadcom and KLA Corp.\n\nIntel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) showed one of the largest quarter-over-quarter increases in fund interest, though total ownership remained low at just 9%. Meanwhile, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Skyworks (NASDAQ: SWKS) were among the most underweighted.\n\nLong-only funds favored Micron (NASDAQ: MU), Texas Instruments, Synopsys, Broadcom, and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI), while hedge funds leaned toward Lam Research, Teradyne (NASDAQ: TER), and KLA. Short interest was highest in Wolfspeed (NYSE: WOLF) and Axcelis (NASDAQ: ACLS), while Nvidia and Broadcom had the lowest.\n\nBofA analysts suggest Nvidia's underweighting versus peers signals room for further portfolio rotation.",
