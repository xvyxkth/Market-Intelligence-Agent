        "body": "Nvidia and Apple make the cut, along with a host of software stocks\n\nArtificial intelligence has been referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. The technology is expected to advance society to the degree that things like the steam engine, electricity and the internet once did.\n\nWedbush Securities senior equity analyst Daniel Ives, known for his vocal and bullish stance on tech stocks, has referred to AI as \"the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years.\" He estimates that the global AI market is expected to grow to $407 billion by 2027 and to $1.81 trillion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate of 36%.\n\nBut AI isn't a recent development. Its gradual evolution has been ongoing for a few decades. However, the release of ChatGPT and apps that can be used by the average person has brought widespread attention to AI, triggering a race by firms to develop and deploy it.\n\nThe buildout phase has a few stages, starting with companies tasked with doing infrastructure development around data centers and the electric grids that power them. Then there are the hyperscalers that provide cloud services to run and train large language models, as well as cybersecurity providers to protect data. Finally, there are companies that will deploy AI through software applications and the internet, allowing people to put it to use.\n\nIves recently released a list of 30 AI-related companies he believes will be key to the revolution, breaking them down by segments. Below is the list - separated by sectors including semiconductors and hardware, hyperscalers, consumer internet, cybersecurity and software, as well as companies involved in autonomous and robotic technologies.\n\nMarketWatch added a column consisting of data compiled from FactSet that shows each stock's potential upside or downside based on Thursday's closing price and analysts' price targets.\n\nSemiconductors and hardware\n\nCompanies within this segment create the semiconductors and hardware materials used to build the computers and components to host AI data centers. Wedbush analysts noted that the global semiconductor market is expected to see a boost by further developments in AI, 5G and the internet of things, and their increased use in government and enterprise.\n\nWhen it comes to the hardware required to support AI's large compute power, Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) tops Wedbush's list of stocks as the leading provider of graphics processing units for data centers and gaming. It's also expected to benefit from supplying the autonomous-vehicles sector as it develops. Similarly, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) supplies central processing units used for computers and gaming.\n\nHyperscalers\n\nThe hyperscaler companies are the cloud providers that help store, train and process large amounts of data. Wedbush analysts refer to this group as \"the immediate beneficiaries of the AI revolution,\" with 15% of cloud services now having AI integration. Companies within this segment are expected to be key players in the development of AI, with spending on AI expected to top $325 billion for 2025.\n\nIn this group, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) suite of office products is a great starting base for integrating AI tools, and the company is ramping up prices for its offerings. Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing division is a favorite among enterprise customers.\n\nWhile Alphabet Inc.'s stock (GOOG) (GOOGL) is a bit more contested because it could lose search-engine volume and advertising dollars to AI, the company is also well positioned to take advantage of the technology. Investors are closely watching whether Google can continue to grow its cloud business in large strides.\n\nConsumer internet\n\nAccording to Wedbush analysts, this segment of companies can monetize AI in four ways. They include providing AI agents, further automating and optimizing advertising tools and pricing for ads, improving search capabilities and the ability to recommend content, and integrating generative AI into hardware products.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL) has a rich ecosystem of apps that makes its products sticky, meaning customers tend to remain loyal to the brand. It's also working on its own version of AI called Apple Intelligence, which boasts privacy and data-safety advantages. However, the stock has taken a hit due to the looming threat of tariffs, as investors try to digest the possible impacts to its supply chain.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (META) is largely dependent on ad revenue, and any advancements to its AI capabilities are expected to help improve its ad-targeting tools. The social-networking giant is also building out its large language model, which competes with the likes of Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT. On this front, investors are watching for how the company will be able to monetize its efforts. Wedbush analysts believe that Meta can spend big on AI without cause for investor concern, because it is growing its expenses more slowly this year.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nThese companies are leaders in the cybersecurity space, and investing in their services will be critical for companies that want to protect their data. Wedbush estimates that cybercrime will cost firms $23 trillion by 2027, a sharp increase from $10.5 trillion in 2025.\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) is well positioned to be a beneficiary of the growing demand for cybersecurity. Wedbush analysts believe that its move to combine its services into a single platform is a good business decision that will help it gain market share.\n\nSoftware\n\nSoftware is the bridge between AI and the ability to put it to good use by people and companies. Stocks within this sector are expected to be big beneficiaries as they find new ways to deploy AI for solutions.\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) combines big data with AI to supply governments and companies with software that can optimize their internal processes. However, the stock recently changed hands near $117, above the consensus price target of about $100, following a strong April rally that was fueled by investor optimism over its future.\n\nWhen it comes to customer-relations management (CRM) platforms, Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is a favorite of Wedbush. Analysts at the firm are optimistic over its Agentforce platform, which allows enterprise customers to build out autonomous agents.\n\nWedbush analysts also refer to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) as one of their \"top software names,\" as the company continues to spend on AI to benefit from productivity growth.\n\nAutonomous and robotics\n\nRobots and autonomous-driving vehicles were once the thing of movies - but they're expected to become a reality as AI integrates with machines.\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA) is a key player in the autonomous space. The company has captivated investor imaginations when it comes to its development of robots like Optimus and self-driving cars. However, the company's biggest opportunities are still in what feels like a distant future. For 2025, Tesla is expected to face a slowdown in sales for its core EV business.\n\n-Laila Maidan\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

        "title": "1 Simple Reason That Alphabet Should Be Worth More Than Apple or Microsoft",
        "body": "Recently, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) lost its title as the world's largest company to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). However, there's another business lurking behind these two that could feasibly be worth more than either: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). It's one of the world's most profitable companies, and produces an unreal amount of earnings. However, it doesn't have the premium valuation that those two do.\n\nSo, if the market decided to snap its fingers and value these companies at the same level tomorrow, Alphabet could be the world's most valuable company. But is there a good reason for the pessimism?\n\nIf you look at the valuations, Alphabet is clearly valued much lower than its big tech peers.\n\nThis is despite generating far more net income over the past year.\n\nThere are a few factors at play for Alphabet's cheap valuation. First, its business is primarily advertising. In the first quarter, $61.6 billion of its $80.5 billion in revenue came from advertising-related sources. The market views this as a potential liability, as advertising budgets tend to get cut during an economic downturn.\n\nConsidering that the U.S. economy may be on the doorstep of one, the market is taking no chances and is not a rabid buyer of the stock. Even during an economic boom, there's still that sense of danger in the back of investors' minds that the good times don't last forever, which is why Alphabet rarely has a huge premium attached to its stock.\n\nStill, Alphabet's situation is hardly different from that of Apple, as Apple relies on sales of consumer electronics. Its devices aren't the cheapest around, and an economic downturn could push consumers to cheaper alternatives or cause them to delay purchases. As a result, Apple is just as vulnerable to a downturn as Alphabet, so its premium doesn't make a ton of sense, at least from that standpoint.\n\nMicrosoft has a slightly stronger business model, especially with its heavy reliance on cloud computing and business software. While it may see its growth slow down, it's unlikely to lose many sales, unlike Alphabet and Apple. So, Microsoft likely deserves a more premium valuation than these two. But double Alphabet's valuation seems a bit absurd.",

        "title": "Bill Gates is giving away 99% of his money. You can bet your heirs have noticed.",
        "body": "Most of us can't be as philanthropic as Gates, but we should plan for our legacy\n\nGates's announcement is a springboard to consider the value of giving away more money now, not later.\n\nPosting on his blog last Thursday, Bill Gates shocked the philanthropic world with a stunning announcement: the Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder will accelerate his plans to give away almost all of his wealth over the next 20 years.\n\nHe vowed to reduce his net worth (currently estimated at roughly $168 billion) by 99%, donating it all through his Gates Foundation. In 20 years, the foundation will shut down.\n\nRead: Here's how much of his fortune Bill Gates will leave to his kids - but who gets the $130 million Washington estate?\n\nWhile most of us might admire Gates's intent to use his money to tackle urgent problems now and not \"die rich,\" the news may resonate even more with the wealthiest Americans. Many of them have set up charitable foundations, built on vast fortunes, that are designed to outlive them.\n\n\"Bill Gates is saying he can make more of a difference by giving his money away over 20 years as opposed to keeping his foundation going in perpetuity,\" said Mitchell Kraus, a certified financial planner in Santa Monica, Calif. \"That can be a great talking point for high-net-worth and ultrahigh-net-worth clients to question their giving [strategy].\"\n\nKraus, who hosts the Giving Intelligence podcast, understands that he can't preach about philanthropy. With his clients, he probes to uncover their goals and values - and works from there to raise their awareness of charitable options.\n\n\"It's often a multiyear process,\" he said. \"It's planting seeds. I may say, 'I don't think you're ready for this now, but let me throw it out there and we'll discuss it again in a year.'\"\n\nThat way, Kraus begins a conversation about philanthropic vehicles such as donor-advised funds, charitable remainder trusts, charitable lead trusts and starting a foundation. Presenting these possibilities to charitably minded clients can motivate them to follow through later.\n\nTo get clients to maximize their philanthropy, Kraus helps them make a conceptual shift in how they see the world. \"Most of the wealthiest Americans have spent their life building a fortune and are in a growth mindset, not a giving mindset,\" he said.\n\nOnce people adopt a giving mindset, they can appreciate its practical benefits and tax-avoidance strategies. Still, for many Americans, there are limited tax advantages for making large charitable donations. But the wealthiest have more tax-saving opportunities.\n\nCase in point: the estate-tax exemption. Estates of individuals who die in 2025 have a basic exclusion amount of $13.99 million ($27.98 million for married couples). In 2026, this may revert to $5.48 million if Congress doesn't intervene (although the amount would be adjusted for inflation).\n\n\"It's more likely that it will be extended, although Congress probably won't make it permanent,\" said Yesenia Realejo, a certified financial planner in Plantation, Fla.\n\nRealejo might encourage wealthy clients to donate any amount above the estate-tax exemption to charity. \"It's an incredibly effective and simple tool to eliminate their estate tax while also benefiting causes important to them,\" she said.\n\nBut she doubts that the Gates news will significantly impact her clients' attitudes about giving. \"The reason they donate is extremely personal,\" she said. \"I can't see external factors, like what Bill Gates is doing, influencing them much.\"\n\nOn the other hand, some financial advisers see the Gates announcement as a springboard for clients to consider the value of giving away more money now, not later. For example, the philanthropically minded can benefit from a qualified charitable contribution (QCD). Once you hit age 70-and-a-half, you can donate a chunk of your IRA directly to a qualified charity -with up to $108,000 per person, in 2025, excluded from taxable income. \"It becomes a de facto tax deduction,\" said Owen Malcolm, a certified financial planner in Peachtree Corners, Ga.\n\n\"Hopefully, what Bill Gates is doing causes some self-reflection,\" he added. \"It can be a time to ask, 'What about my legacy?'\"\n\nRead: Bill Gates will give away $200 billion in the next 20 years. It's nearly all his wealth.\n\nMore: Warren Buffett's succession plan has begun.

        "body": "Why technology stocks are projected to outpace defensives through 2027 - and whether they present a buying opportunity for investors\n\nTechnology stocks are back in charge after a rocky start to the year - a comeback that feels all too familiar as investors hope to keep April's market slide firmly in the rearview mirror.\n\nAfter falling out of favor in the first four months of 2025, the so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap tech companies has fueled the stock market's May recovery from the sharp selloff seen last month, after President Donald Trump announced aggressive and far-reaching trade tariffs on April 2.\n\nInvestors are now wondering what it will take for tech stocks to maintain their leadership for the rest of the year - and how to position their portfolios should volatility return to U.S. financial markets.\n\nThe Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS, which offers equal-weight exposure to the seven megacap companies - Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA) - has risen 18.2% since its recent low on April 8, according to FactSet data.\n\n\"Those oversold conditions in April led investors back into some of the previous market leaders amid potential de-escalation in trade tensions, and the fact that the U.S. economy may avoid falling into a recession,\" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise.\n\nStrong first-quarter earnings for tech companies also helped the Magnificent Seven rally off their April lows and drew investors back to megacap names, defying market concerns about the durability of the artificial-intelligence theme and the long-term profitability of these companies, Saglimbene told MarketWatch in a phone interview.\n\nSlightly less aggressive valuations for Big Tech have also lured investors back in. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF fell to around 23 on April 8, from about 30 earlier this year. It was the lowest level since the fund's inception in April 2023, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nBig Tech still lagging this year\n\nWhile the rebound in the Magnificent Seven over the past two weeks offered some relief for retail investors aggressively buying the dip in the stock market, it was not enough to boost their year-to-date performance. The tech-related sectors of the S&P 500 SPX have still underperformed both the broader large-cap index and its defensive sectors so far this year, signaling a degree of hesitancy among investors about pushing tech stocks back into the stratosphere.\n\nRead from February: Is it a bubble? 'Magnificent 7' market cap now equals the GDP of 11 major world cities.\n\nIn another cautious signal, the S&P 500's consumer-discretionary sector XX:SP500.25 has slumped 11.7% so far in 2025, while the information-technology XX:SP500.45 and communication-services sectors XX:SP500.50 were off 8.2% and 4.5%, respecitvely, in the same period, according to FactSet data.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, shares of utilities and consumer-staples companies - the market's traditional defensive sectors - have stood out among the best stock-market performers in the early months of 2025. The S&P 500's utilities sector XX:SP500.55 has popped 5.8% so far this year, while the consumer-staples sector XX:SP500.30 has risen 4.4% in the same period, according to FactSet.\n\nBet on Big Tech or stick with a defensive approach?\n\nTo be sure, investors were on the hunt for ways to play defense in the early months of 2025, as concerns over economic growth and President Trump's tariff plans put Wall Street on edge.\n\nBut now, strong earnings from technology companies have left many torn between betting on a further tech rally or sticking with a defensive approach.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings results have highlighted a widening dispersion in earnings growth between Big Tech and nontech companies, according to Barclays.\n\nMegacap technology firms beat annual earning-per-share growth estimates by 8% in the first three months of 2025, while nontech earnings fell short of forecasts in the same period, a team of Barclays strategists led by Venu Krishna said in a Thursday client note.\n\nEarnings expectations are also favorable for technology names: Cyclical stocks are projected to outpace defensives through 2027, according to Janus Henderson Investors (see table above).\n\nTo be sure, another reason why megacap tech companies came under pressure this year - aside from tariffs that could punish international sales - was concerns about potential overspending by U.S. companies on AI infrastructure after China's release of the DeepSeek platform.\n\n\"First-quarter earnings trends showed resilience in cyclical sectors like technology and communication services, while estimates in defensive areas of the market like utilities and food producers saw flat to lower forecasts,\" said Jeremiah Buckley, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.\n\nHowever, some strategists caution against drawing direct parallels between the performance of the Magnificent Seven and defensive stocks, because they appeal to different types of investors for different reasons.\n\nStocks in the utilities, consumer-staples and healthcare sectors are often considered defensive since these companies tend to operate in less cyclical industries, making them less sensitive to economic downturns - and thus helping investors to hedge portfolio risks.\n\n\"You're not getting the same level of earnings growth [each quarter for defensive stocks], but if there is an escalating trade war or a recession, these companies should do well ... so you're paying for defense,\" Mike Cornacchioli, senior vice president for investment strategy at Citizens Private Wealth, told MarketWatch via phone.\n\nSee: Trump floats 80% tariff on China. Here's why that level could sink this weekend's talks.\n\nThat puts this weekend's U.S.-China trade talks in focus as the next major event for investors, even though the stock market is closed over the weekend. Officials from the world's two largest economies are set to meet in Geneva, Switzerland on Saturday, as Washington and Beijing seek to navigate a path forward amid a bruising trade fight.\n\nU.S. stocks finished the week lower on Friday.
