        "title": "Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO): Among the Cheap ESG Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds",
        "body": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Cheap ESG Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against the other cheap ESG stocks.\n\nThese days, it seems like everyone wants to wear the \"saving the world\" cape. Whether this urge to make a real impact on the world stems from a desire to ride the social trend wave or simply out of genuine concern is, well, a debate for another day. For now, let's focus on the fact that all companies must adhere to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) by law.\n\nIn other words, ESG companies are those that incorporate Environmental, Social, and Governance factors into their operations and decision-making. This framework is utilized to measure an organization's practices and performance on sustainability and ethical grounds. In capital markets, some investors employ ESG criteria to assess companies and make their investment decisions accordingly, a practice known as ESG investing. While investing delivers financial returns, ESG investing offers both financial returns and societal impacts, and that's what is most valued by some investors.\n\nSome believe ESG investing is aligned with reduced risk exposure, stakeholder interests, and superior returns. Not only attractive in theory, but there are reports that back this form of investing. For instance, the Sustainability Megatrends Report by Cushman & Wakefield reveals that ESG companies are gaining traction from institutional investors. A survey of 250 institutional investors indicated that around 60% noted higher performance yield from ESG investments, and 78% were willing to pay higher premiums for these funds.\n\n\"Institutional investors are showing increased demand for properties with strong ESG-related management and activities,\" the report underscores.\n\nA US SIF \"Trends Report\" reveals that out of the US market size of $52.5 trillion, $6.5 trillion (12%) is identified as a sustainable or ESG investment. Having said that, as many as 73% of respondents believe the sustainable investment market will grow over the next few years. Therefore, community investing continues to shine with rising enthusiasm across several types of investors.\n\nESG companies are mainly ranked by third-party ranking agencies based on how well they perform across Environmental, Social, and Governance indicators. Using standardized metrics, proprietary models, and disclosures, the companies are then assessed and compared. Among the most notable agencies are MSCI, Sustainalytics (by Morningstar), Refinitiv ESG Scores, and S&P Global ESG Scores. In this analysis, we have used the ratings by Sustainalytics, which covers over 15,000 firms across 42 industries globally. The firm recently disclosed its 2025 list of ESG Top-Rated Companies, identifying Global 50 Top-Rated companies and other regional and industry leaders. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best ESG stocks to consider.",

        "title": "Cisco Reveals AI Fueling New Wave of Cybersecurity Risks for Canadian Organizations - Weekly Voice",
        "body": "AI is fueling a new cybersecurity arms race: 80 per cent of Canadian organizations experienced AI-related incidents last year. Readiness remains low: Just three per cent of organizations report having a mature level of readiness. Blind spots persist: Only 41 per cent of organizations have staff with a strong understanding of AI risks -- and many key cybersecurity roles remain unfilled. TORONTO , May 8, 2025 /CNW/ - Only three per cent of Canadian organizations are fully prepared to defend against today's cybersecurity threats, according to Cisco's (NASDAQ: CSCO) 2025 Cybersecurity Readiness Index . While this marks a slight improvement from last year (1%), readiness remains alarmingly low as hyperconnectivity and AI continue to add new layers of security complexities.\n\nAI is revolutionizing security and escalating threat levels, with 80 per cent of Canadian organizations facing AI-related incidents in the past year. Among them, the most common were AI-powered phishing scams and social engineering attacks (41%), where GenAI tools are used to craft tailored phishing emails, clone voices and create deepfakes. Others faced attempts to steal or misuse AI models (38%), or had their systems tampered with using bad data to trick AI decision-making (22%).\n\nAs pressure to adopt AI mounts, a critical knowledge gap is emerging inside organizations leaving them exposed. Only 41 per cent of Canadian organizations are confident their employees fully understand AI-related threats. Even fewer (26%) feel equipped to conduct comprehensive AI security assessments.\n\nAI is compounding an already challenging threat landscape. In the last year, 37 per cent organizations suffered cyberattacks, hindered by complex security frameworks with disparate point solutions. Looking forward, respondents view external threats like malicious actors and state-affiliated groups (60%) as more significant to their organizations than internal threats (40%), underscoring the urgent need for streamlined defense strategies to thwart external attacks.\n\n\"As AI transforms the enterprise, we are dealing with an entirely new class of risks at unprecedented scale - putting even more pressure on our infrastructure and those who defend it,\" said Cisco Chief Product Officer Jeetu Patel . \"This year's report continues to reveal alarming gaps in security readiness and a lack of urgency to address them. Organizations must rethink their strategies now or risk becoming irrelevant in the AI era.\"\n\n2025 Cisco Cybersecurity Readiness Index: Cybersecurity Readiness Remains Flat as AI Transforms the Industry\n\nThe Index evaluates companies' readiness across five pillars -- Identity Intelligence , Machine Trustworthiness, Network Resilience , Cloud Reinforcement , and AI Fortification -- and encompasses 31 solutions and capabilities. Based on a double-blind survey of 8,000 private sector security and business leaders in 30 global markets, respondents detailed their deployment stages for each solution. Companies were then categorized into four readiness stages: Beginner, Formative, Progressive, and Mature.\n\nFindings\n\nThe lack of cybersecurity readiness globally is alarming as 65 per cent of respondents anticipate business disruptions from cyber incidents within the next 12 to 24 months. Further:\n\nAI's Expanding Role in Cybersecurity: An impressive 82 per cent of organizations use AI to understand threats better, 80 per cent for threat detection, 66 per cent for response and recovery, underscoring AI's vital role in strengthening cybersecurity strategies. GenAI Deployment Risks: GenAI tools are widely adopted, with 50 per cent of employees using approved third-party tools. However, 17 per cent have unrestricted access to public GenAI, and 72 per cent of IT teams are unaware of employee interactions with GenAI, underscoring major oversight challenges. Shadow AI Concerns: Sixty-seven percent of organizations lack confidence in detecting unregulated AI deployments, or shadow AI, posing significant cybersecurity and data privacy risks. Unmanaged Device Vulnerability: Within hybrid work models, 74 per cent of organizations face increased security risks as employees access networks from unmanaged devices, further exacerbated by using unapproved Gen AI tools. Investment Priorities Shift: While 94 per cent of organizations plan to upgrade their IT infrastructure, only 33 per cent allocate more than 10 per cent of their IT budget towards cybersecurity, emphasizing a critical need for more focused investment in comprehensive defense strategies, which is incredibly important as threats are not slowing. Complex Security Postures: Over 67 per cent of organizations believe that the adoption of too many security solutions has in fact slowed down their team's ability to detect, respond and recover from incidents, with over 60 per cent of organizations having 10 or more point solutions in their security stack. Talent Shortage Impedes Progress: A staggering 85 per cent of respondents identify the shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals as a major challenge, with 46 per cent reporting more than ten positions to fill. \"AI has pulled back the curtain on cybersecurity blind spots that many Canadian organizations didn't realize existed,\" said Robert Barton , Chief Technology Officer, Cisco Canada. \"As AI-driven threats evolve, so too must our defenses. It's no longer about keeping pace, it's about setting the pace for security resilience.\"\n\nTo tackle today's cybersecurity challenges, organizations must invest in AI-driven solutions, simplify security infrastructures, and enhance AI threat awareness. Prioritizing AI for threat detection, response, and recovery is essential, as is addressing talent shortages and managing risks from unmanaged devices and shadow AI.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nMicrosite Cybersecurity Readiness Assessment Tool About Cisco\n\nCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that is revolutionizing the way organizations connect and protect in the AI era.

        "body": "Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco S&P 100 Equal Weight ETF (Symbol: EQWL), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $115.86 per unit.\n\nWith EQWL trading at a recent price near $101.74 per unit, that means that analysts see 13.88% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EQWL's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Target Corp (Symbol: TGT), Walt Disney Co. (Symbol: DIS), and Cisco Systems Inc (Symbol: CSCO). Although TGT has traded at a recent price of $95.49/share, the average analyst target is 37.68% higher at $131.47/share. Similarly, DIS has 21.88% upside from the recent share price of $102.09 if the average analyst target price of $124.42/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CSCO to reach a target price of $69.67/share, which is 16.95% above the recent price of $59.57. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of TGT, DIS, and CSCO:\n\nBelow is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:\n\nAre analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",
