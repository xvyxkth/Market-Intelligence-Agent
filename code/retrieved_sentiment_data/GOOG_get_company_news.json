        "title": "Do Strong Earnings Results and a Dividend Hike Make Alphabet a Growth Stock to Buy Right Now?",
        "body": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) reported excellent first-quarter 2025 earnings. It also raised its dividend by 5%, marking the first raise since Alphabet initiated its dividend last year.\n\nAnd yet, Alphabet is still down big year to date -- underperforming the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) and many of its megacap growth stock peers.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \"\n\nHere's why Alphabet's latest results reinforce its underlying investment thesis and why Alphabet is a top growth stock to buy now.\n\nThere was a lot to like from Alphabet's latest print.\n\nRevenue jumped 12% while operating income grew by 20% and diluted earnings per share (EPS) skyrocketed 49%.\n\nHigh-margin segments like Google Search and YouTube have led to steadily rising revenue and a 10-year-high operating margin.\n\nGOOGL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nAlphabet breaks up its business into two segments: services and Google Cloud.\n\nServices include Google Search, YouTube, Google Network, and subscriptions, platforms, and devices.\n\nServices brought in $77.26 billion in revenue in the recent quarter, $50.7 billion of which was Google Search. The segment's operating income was a whopping $32.68 billion -- good for a 42.3% operating margin.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud brought in $12.26 billion in revenue -- a 28% year-over-year increase. But it only booked $2.18 billion in operating income for an operating margin of 17.8%. Granted, margins could be a lot higher if Alphabet weren't in expansion mode. But margins are low because Alphabet is pouring resources to try to take market share from rivals like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.\n\nRisks worth considering\n\nAlphabet's results were excellent, so investors may be wondering why the stock price remains beaten down. Arguably, the two primary reasons are Alphabet's increased spending and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of Google Search.\n\nAlphabet's capital expenditures (capex) in the recent quarter were $17.2 billion -- a staggering 43% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024. For the time being, Alphabet can absorb higher capex since it is growing revenue and operating margins at such a strong pace. But it needs to keep up the pace to justify higher spending.\n\nThe elephant in the room is Google Search. As mentioned, Google Search ad revenue topped $50 billion in the recent quarter, or 56.2% of total revenue. But Google Search is under pressure from rival information resources like ChatGPT or even TikTok and Meta Platforms' Instagram, which younger generations are increasingly using to search for information and content. Last week, Meta Platforms released a stand-alone AI app powered by Llama 4 -- its latest large language model.\n\nIn sum, it's unclear if Alphabet's high capex will pay off or if Google Search will stay as dominant as it has been for decades. Or put another way, it seems Alphabet is on the defensive, whereas peers like Meta have a clearer trajectory toward sustainable growth.\n\nReturning tons of capital to shareholders\n\nAlphabet's increasing competition shouldn't overshadow its impeccable capital return program. In the recent quarter, Alphabet spent $17.5 billion on its capital return program -- consisting of $15.07 billion in buybacks and $2.43 billion in dividends. It's nice that Alphabet is now paying a dividend, but buybacks are still magnitudes larger.\n\nThe run rate of the capital return program for a full year is about $70 billion, or 3.5% of Alphabet's roughly $2 trillion market cap. Meaning that if Alphabet only paid dividends and didn't repurchase stock, it would yield 3.5%.\n\nBuybacks have a major impact over time because they reduce the outstanding share count -- thereby increasing EPS. Dividends, by contrast, are a one-time benefit, and shareholders must pay taxes on dividends in non-retirement accounts.\n\nOver the last five years, Alphabet has reduced its share count by a staggering 10.9%. That's nearly as much as Apple's 12.3% reduction -- and Apple is known for its aggressive buybacks. Buybacks have allowed Alphabet's EPS to grow much faster than net income -- giving Alphabet a dirt cheap valuation.\n\nAlphabet's cheap valuation reflects investor skepticism on its ability to monetize artificial intelligence relative to other megacap growth companies. But that doubt is arguably baked into Alphabet's valuation.\n\nA 17.7 P/E ratio isn't just low -- it's a bargain-bin level for a high-margin company that continues to grow at an impressive rate. For context, safe and stodgy dividend-paying Procter & Gamble has a P/E ratio over 25. That's no knock on P&G, as it deserves a premium valuation. But P&G doesn't have Alphabet's growth prospects or margins.\n\nA balanced buy at a compelling valuation\n\nAlphabet is typically viewed as a growth stock, but its earnings multiple puts it in value stock territory. The dividend yield of 0.5% is misleading, considering Alphabet spends the bulk of its capital return program on buybacks.\n\nAlphabet is priced as if it is doomed to margin compression and lost market share -- when its results indicate the opposite. Investors are getting a phenomenal opportunity to scoop up shares of Alphabet while they are stuck in the bargain bin.\n\nHowever, if you do buy Alphabet, it is worth keeping a tight watch over its capex, its ability to take market share from other cloud competitors, and the resiliency of Google Search in the face of mounting competition.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Alphabet Be in 5 Years? todayheadline",
        "body": "Today, the lowest-valued stock in the \"Magnificent Seven\" is Alphabet (GOOG 1.83%) (GOOGL 1.69%), and it's not close. In fact, Alphabet even trades at a lower valuation than the overall market. That's quite a shocking development considering Alphabet's long track record of success and innovation capabilities.\n\nThe market is currently focused on the rise of artificial intelligence chatbots and their implications for Alphabet's core Search business. However, not only is Alphabet making solid moves to sustain Search's relevance, but the company also has not one but three other major businesses growing really fast.\n\nFive years from now, Alphabet's earnings look like they'll be more balanced between not just a resilient Search business but also all four of these major business lines.\n\nAt first glance, it's unsurprising that investors may be worried about AI's impact on Alphabet. After all, Alphabet has long had a virtual monopoly on Search, which is a very profitable business that routinely grows double-digits year in and year out.\n\nBut at a massive $200 billion revenue run-rate, investors may begin wondering how much Search could grow from here, even without challengers. And when you add the new competitive threat from AI chatbots ChatGPT, Anthropic, Perplexity and others, it makes sense that some see the end of Alphabet's dominance in the years ahead.\n\nHowever, Alphabet has rapidly caught up in frontier large language models (LLMs), rolling out its Gemini 2.5 model one month ago. Upon the rollout, Gemini is generating positive reviews, with some saying that in several use cases, Gemini 2.5 compares favorably to ChatGPT 4.5, which is currently regarded as the best-in-class model. On the recent call with analysts, CEO Sundar Pichai noted, \"By many metrics, I think we have the best model out there now.\"\n\nRegardless of how Gemini compares to ChatGPT, Alphabet has clearly closed the big gap between Gemini and early AI leaders over the past couple of years.\n\nInvestors may also be underestimating the advantages Google Search has as consumers adapt to using AI. To that end, Alphabet is infusing and improving the existing Search experience -- which is still a part of billions of people's daily routines -- with increased AI capabilities. After all, Alphabet still managed to grow its Search and Other segment by 13.1% in 2024 despite the emergence of various LLMs.\n\nExactly one year ago, Google began to implement AI overviews, which essentially use Gemini capabilities to perform an enhanced multipart Search, then summarize the findings, helping users piece multipart searches together into one quick and easy prompt.\n\nThe good news is that for Alphabet, management has said it monetizes AI overviews at the same rate as traditional Search. That appears evident in Search's continued revenue growth.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet is currently testing a new Search feature called \"AI mode,\" which allows for even more complex multipart and multimodel queries and enables follow-up questions. The beta testing began last month, and when AI mode is rolled out, Alphabet will have two AI enhancements to the existing Search experience, along with the premium Gemini model.\n\nPeople still have a strong Google Search habit, evidenced by its size and growth last year. And given that most AI start-ups like ChatGPT are mostly losing money and rely on subscriptions -- or getting people to pay for AI -- Google's free ad-based Search franchise, which is already an ingrained habit, may give it a competitive advantage in terms of retaining its large audience and affording it more time and resources to compete over the long term.\n\nWhile Search is still Alphabet's main business, at 56% of revenue and likely an even higher share of profits, Alphabet has been cultivating several other segments for years that are just now hitting inflection points. In five years, they are likely to contribute a much greater percentage of revenue and profit. The three key future growth drivers are YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo.\n\nAfter 20 years, YouTube has become the dominant online streaming video platform and continues making inroads into traditional media through subscription and ad-based formats. Last year, YouTube ads grew 15%. And while Alphabet lumps YouTube subscriptions in with all its other subscription services, overall subscriptions grew 16%.\n\nMeanwhile, while Google was once an afterthought and a late entrant in cloud computing, it has become a formidable business in today's three-company cloud infrastructure oligopoly. Last year, Google Cloud grew 31% to $43.2 billion in revenue and $6.1 billion in operating profit.\n\nGoogle Cloud just became profitable in the first quarter of 2023, and its margin has expanded rapidly with increased scale. In fact, Google Cloud's operating margin nearly doubled to 17.8% in the first quarter relative to the year-ago quarter. The good news is that even that improved margin is still well below the other two larger cloud leaders, leaving much more margin expansion to go.\n\nGiven that growth trajectory and the prospect of increased margins, it's not a stretch to think Google Cloud's profitability could become a very meaningful contributor to Alphabet's overall profits in five years, from nearly zero just two years ago.\n\nFinally, another huge potential business in the making isn't even contributing any profit at the moment but rather generating losses: Waymo.\n\nBut 2024 was a huge year for the fledgling autonomous robotaxi service, as the company expanded its Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles services. In December, YipIt data reported that Waymo had achieved a 22% share of the ride-hailing market in San Francisco, on par with Lyft just 15 months after launch.\n\nAs of early 2025, Sundar Pichai noted that Waymo was already providing 200,000 paid rides per week. Waymo's recent launch in Austin, Texas, in March has reportedly been a big success, generating twice as many cumulative rides in its first month as the San Francisco launch two years ago.\n\nOf course, Waymo isn't the only company trying to get into the autonomous taxi game. Tesla (TSLA 2.41%) is set to launch its robotaxi service in June. Other autonomous driving start-ups are also looking to make a splash.\n\nStill, there is something to be said for Waymo being first-to-market with autonomous taxis, both from a first-mover and name-recognition perspective in generating rider trust. After all, the longer Waymo has been on the road without incident, the more trusted it will become, making it more of a go-to for prospective riders.\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles have been seen as somewhat of a risky science experiment to date, the projections for market growth are massive. Various research firms are putting the total market size between $370 billion and $450 billion by 2033 -- and it is sure to grow from there.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen how the competition shakes out, Waymo is likely to get a significant share of that pie as the early leader. That would make it a fourth massive business under Alphabet's umbrella, along with Search, YouTube, and Cloud.\n\nWhile it's true that Search has competitive questions today, investors should still expect Search to generate huge profits in the years ahead, even if growth slows down over the next five years. However, Alphabet's valuation seems to be more than factoring that in. But the biggest difference to Alphabet five years out will be that Search is likely to decrease in importance, especially as Google Cloud and Waymo come into their own.\n\nAs long as Alphabet can maintain Search profitability as it matures and fights LLMs, the other non-search franchises should pick up the slack in terms of growth. If that comes to pass, the stock is a solid value today -- if not a bargain.",
