        "title": "MarketBeat Week in Review - 05/05 - 05/09",
        "body": "Investors will get the latest reading on inflation when the April CPI and PPI are released; both numbers are not expected to show much change from the prior month.\n\nEquities moved higher this week as investors cheered news of the Trump administration's first trade deal. More importantly, talks between the U.S. and China this week may signal more clarity around trading with the country's largest trading partner.\n\nThe trade deal reversed the bearish momentum in stocks after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. Next week, investors will get the next inflation reading, the April reading of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI). Both numbers are expected to be in line with expectations, which could push future rate cuts later into the year, if at all.\n\nThe peak of earnings season is past, but there will still be many names reporting next week. Investors continue to focus less on the headline number and more on the guidance, which has generally been mixed to lower. Without further clarity on trade deals, it could keep resistance on the S&P 500 at around the 5,700 level. You can count on the MarketBeat analysts to keep you informed about the stocks and stories moving the markets. Here are some of our most popular stories from this week.\n\nArticles by Thomas Hughes\n\nUnited Parcel Service Inc. NYSE: UPS is considered a bellwether for the economy. But as Thomas Hughes wrote this week, it appears that the worst has been priced into the stock. This supports his thesis that UPS stock could be set up as a generational buying opportunity after a solid earnings report, even if the turnaround will take a couple of quarters to materialize.\n\nOne of the hopeful applications for artificial intelligence (AI) is in the area of drug discovery. Tempus AI Inc. NASDAQ: TEM is a leader in this area. Short sellers have kept the stock price down, but Hughes explained why the company's positive earnings report is stirring interest from institutions and could set the stage for a significant rally.\n\nSpeaking of short sellers, Hughes wrote about the impact of a short report on Monster Beverage Inc. NASDAQ: MNST stock. However, Hughes cautioned investors about the prospects for a short squeeze and explained why MNST stock may do just fine without one.\n\nArticles by Sam Quirke\n\nIs the worst behind Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA? Shares of TSLA stock are up 30% from before the company's earnings report. Sam Quirke explained why technical signals and analyst sentiment point to an extended rally in the beaten-down stock.\n\nWhat a difference a week makes. Shares of Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN stock dropped after a mostly positive earnings report. However, Quirke pointed out the rally in AMZN stock this week as evidence that investors are turning more bullish now that they've had a chance to digest the report.\n\nThe same can't be said for Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM. After a post-earnings rally, Quirke explained why QCOM stock was struggling to find direction and why mixed analyst sentiment is likely to weigh on any immediate upside.\n\nArticles by Chris Markoch\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR kicked off this week with a blockbuster earnings report. But shares fell sharply after the report over concerns about future earnings growth for an objectively overvalued stock. Chris Markoch broke down the report and explained why investors shouldn't allow traders' short-term actions to impact their long-term outlook.\n\nIs the magic back for The Walt Disney Co. NYSE: DIS? It was for at least the past quarter. Disney delivered a stellar earnings report with strong results from its theme parks and a record number of Disney+ subscribers. However, Markoch cautioned investors that sharp price action may not lead to a sustainable rebound.\n\nAfter delivering a solid earnings report last week, Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT announced it would be raising the price of its popular Xbox gaming console. While this decision shows that Microsoft is not immune to tariff concerns, Markoch explained that the scope of this business shouldn't be enough to derail the stock's bullish momentum.\n\nArticles by Ryan Hasson\n\nWhen you're a high-flying stock like Rocket Lab USA Inc. NASDAQ: RKLB, earnings reports can make or break short-term momentum. Rocket Lab reported earnings on May 8, but before the report came out, Ryan Hasson outlined the key things that investors should watch for in the report.\n\nOne sign that bullish sentiment may be returning to the market is that investors are looking at mid-cap stocks. This week, Hasson analyzed three mid-cap medical stocks with strong momentum, bullish analyst sentiment, and the potential to move higher.\n\nAlphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL stock remains under pressure as threats to its massive search business continue to pop up. The latest threat comes from Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL, which is making moves that could remove Google as the default search engine on Safari. But Hasson explained that the company has other revenue levers to pull from, and that's why the stock may be undervalued.\n\nArticles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli\n\nMany companies use earnings season as an opportunity to announce share buybacks. That was the case with Wells Fargo & Co. NYSE: WFC, which announced an impressive $40 billion buyback program. Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli reminded investors that it's important to consider why a company may want to buy back its stock. In the case of Wells Fargo, Osorio-Mazilli explained it could be a case of the worst outcome for the bank already being priced in.\n\nOne of the most anticipated earnings reports among technology stocks came from Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI. Osorio-Mazilli previewed the earnings report, which comes with the hope that the company's accounting irregularities are behind it.\n\nIf the bulls are getting ready to run, the surge in Bitcoin may turn out to be the signal and not more noise. If that's the case, investors may want to consider Bitcoin-related stocks. Osorio-Mazilli helped you with your research by highlighting three bitcoin stocks that provide indirect exposure with less risk.\n\nArticles by Leo Miller\n\nMany investors are familiar with the idiom of a rising tide lifting all boats. Leo Miller used that thesis to describe the outlook for Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ: AVGO. AVGO stock is rising after several hyperscalers delivered bullish earnings reports. As Miller explained, it's not about whether these are Broadcom customers; it's that the reports are solidifying the AI infrastructure outlook.\n\nAs mentioned above, earnings season is a time for buybacks and/or dividend announcements. This week, Miller spotlighted three technology companies that announced stock buyback commitments totaling $85 billion.\n\nEven as growth investors come back to the market, it's still a good market for value hunters. To help the search, Miller analyzed three sectors that appear to be significantly undervalued based on a low forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\n\nArticles by Nathan Reiff\n\nD-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS continues to be one of the most popular and polarizing stocks in the quantum computing sector. This week, Nathan Reiff examined the stock's recent price action and helped investors understand the opportunity and risk that QBTS stock presents.\n\nEven though the Magnificent Seven stocks may be struggling to regain their luster, Reiff reminded investors that tech stocks are still in favor. But investors are being more discerning and looking for undervalued stocks that analysts love. With that as the goal, Reiff gave investors three tech stocks with niche market appeal and analyst approval.\n\nAnother area for tech investors to look for growth is companies that focus on cloud computing infrastructure. Reiff explained that despite the maturity of the cloud industry, there's still room for these infrastructure stocks to move higher. Read his article to get three stock picks in this massive space.\n\nBefore you consider D-Wave Quantum, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and D-Wave Quantum wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile D-Wave Quantum currently has a Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.",

They were all young girls who'd come through the Glasgow City Academy.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, they've done an amazing job since they came in. They've put in outstanding performances. But that bit of experience has got us through.\n\n\"We want to aim to be the next better team within the bottom half of the split. We aim to be the best performing team in there and we've done that so far.\n\n\"We've scored the most goals, won the most points yet, and with two games to go hopefully we can continue that trajectory.\"\n\nMcConnachie, who returned to the club last summer from Queen's Park, scooped up the women's player's player of the year prize at the club's annual awards night in Port Glasgow Town Hall.\n\nAnd she says she was particularly pleased at getting recognition for.\n\n\"It's an award that I could not be more thankful for,\" she said, \"with the girls voting for you.\n\n\"It's a team effort all year round. It's not just my performance, it's all the girls' performances, so thank you to all the girls that voted for me.\"\n\n\"Coming from an SWPL2 level back to the Championship to help the team, I do expect to perform to a top level, so I create my own standards, although with that I also help try to create a team standard.\n\n\"I've set my own individual targets and I've helped to hit those this year.\n\n\"Next year I hope to improve on that, but an improved team performance all year round is what I want to achieve.\"",

So humbling. So Proud.\n\n\"Thank you to my partner Lauren and to the @WatfordMayor and all the #wfc fans and people of our town for your support.\"\n\nThe 65-year-old was one of only four men to play in all four divisions for Watford in their meteoric climb from the Fourth Division to the First Division.\n\nHis career flourished under coach Tom Walley and the club's greatest ever manager, Graham Taylor, who was the driving force behind bringing the club and community together.\n\nHe became the first black footballer to score a hat-trick for England and was bought by AC Milan for \u00a31 million in 1983.\n\nReflecting on his honour at the time, Blissett said: \"That my career as a footballer can be used by the charities to touch the lives, not just of football fans, but their families and the community as a whole is in itself a great honour.\"",

        "body": "Investing.com -- Un aterrizaje suave sigue siendo el escenario m\u00e1s probable, pero a medida que los riesgos de recesi\u00f3n y estanflaci\u00f3n han aumentado por primera vez desde 2022, los analistas de Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) advierten que este cambio reciente en las probabilidades merece mayor atenci\u00f3n.\n\nLa \u00faltima actualizaci\u00f3n de Wells Fargo muestra que la probabilidad de un aterrizaje suave cay\u00f3 al 40% en el primer trimestre desde el 44% anterior, mientras que las posibilidades de recesi\u00f3n y estanflaci\u00f3n subieron al 27% y 28%, respectivamente.\n\n\"La probabilidad de aterrizaje suave disminuy\u00f3 por primera vez desde 2022, mientras que aumentaron las probabilidades tanto de estanflaci\u00f3n como de recesi\u00f3n\", se\u00f1alaron los analistas.\n\nAunque esta reversi\u00f3n en la tendencia a\u00fan no es alarmante, los analistas advirtieron que \"es algo que debe vigilarse durante los pr\u00f3ximos trimestres, especialmente si los aumentos en las probabilidades de estanflaci\u00f3n y recesi\u00f3n comienzan a consolidarse\".\n\nLas perspectivas est\u00e1n nubladas por la incertidumbre sobre la pol\u00edtica comercial estadounidense. Mientras Wells Fargo cree que los aranceles eventualmente disminuir\u00e1n a aproximadamente 15% y permanecer\u00e1n all\u00ed hasta 2026, no se puede descartar un \"modesto choque estanflacionario\".\n\nLos analistas anticipan un \"camino accidentado para el crecimiento del PIB este a\u00f1o, ya que el gasto de consumidores y empresas disminuye tras el aumento de gastos pre-arancelarios que ocurri\u00f3 durante el primer trimestre y probablemente continu\u00f3 hasta principios del segundo\".\n\nSin embargo, si se mantiene el nivel actual de aranceles, el riesgo de estanflaci\u00f3n o recesi\u00f3n probablemente aumentar\u00eda a medida que los precios al consumidor se disparen.\n\nPara quienes esperan que la Fed rescate la econom\u00eda de los obst\u00e1culos impulsados por los aranceles, un giro en la pol\u00edtica a\u00fan no est\u00e1 en las cartas. Sin embargo, \"un mayor aumento en las probabilidades de estanflaci\u00f3n y/o recesi\u00f3n podr\u00eda incrementar la incertidumbre pol\u00edtica\", dijo Wells Fargo. La probabilidad de un giro \"debe ser observada cuidadosamente en los pr\u00f3ximos trimestres\".",
