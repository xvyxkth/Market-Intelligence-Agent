Retail related revenue represents approximately 75% of total, followed by Amazon Web Services' cloud computing, storage, database, and other offerings (15%), advertising services (5% to 10%), and other the remainder. International segments constitute 25% to 30% of Amazon's non-AWS sales, led by Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan.\n\nUpon a comprehensive analysis of Amazon.com, the following trends can be discerned:\n\nWith a Price to Earnings ratio of 30.73, which is 0.86x less than the industry average, the stock shows potential for growth at a reasonable price, making it an interesting consideration for market participants.\n\nWith a Price to Book ratio of 6.55, which is 1.22x the industry average, Amazon.com might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value, as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers.\n\nThe stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 3.12, surpassing the industry average by 1.9x, may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance.\n\nThe company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 5.79%, which is 0.85% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential.\n\nCompared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $36.48 Billion, which is 4.88x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.\n\nThe company has higher gross profit of $78.69 Billion, which indicates 4.57x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.\n\nWith a revenue growth of 8.62%, which surpasses the industry average of 6.1%, the company is demonstrating robust sales expansion and gaining market share.\n\nDebt To Equity Ratio\n\nThe debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is an important measure to assess the financial structure and risk profile of a company.\n\nConsidering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.\n\nBy considering the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Amazon.com can be compared to its top 4 peers, leading to the following observations:\n\nCompared to its top 4 peers, Amazon.com has a stronger financial position indicated by its lower debt-to-equity ratio of 0.44.\n\nThis suggests that the company relies less on debt financing and has a more favorable balance between debt and equity, which can be seen as a positive attribute by investors.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nFor Amazon.com, the PE ratio is low compared to its peers in the Broadline Retail industry, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest that the market values Amazon.com's assets and sales highly. Amazon.com's high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and revenue growth outperform its industry peers, reflecting strong financial performance and growth potential.\n\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.\n\nAMZNAmazon.com Inc$189.770.56%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?\n\nBenzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock - anytime.\n\nReveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum44.30Growth91.14Quality72.26Value51.14Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",

        "body": "synopsisShopify expects gross profit dollars to grow at a high-teens percentage rate in the current quarter, below analyst expectations of a 21.4% growth.\n\nShopify (SHOP) shares fell more than 5% at market open on Tuesday after the e-commerce platform missed first-quarter earnings forecasts and issued second-quarter guidance below Wall Street's expectations.\n\nThe Canadian company reported a loss of $0.53 per share, well below analyst expectations for a profit of $0.17, according to data from Koyfin. Net loss totaled $682 million, compared with a projected net profit of $341 million.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was $2.36 billion, roughly in line with Wall Street's expected $2.33 billion. Subscription solutions generated $620 million in revenue, while merchant solutions brought in $1.74 billion.\n\n\"Our Q1 results confirm two clear facts. First, we are delivering both growth and profitability at scale. Second, businesses perform better on Shopify, regardless of market conditions,\" said Shopify President Harley Finkelstein.\n\nDespite his optimistic tone, Shopify expects gross profit dollars to grow at a high-teens percentage rate in the current quarter, below analyst expectations of a 21.4% growth.\n\nThe company projected revenue to increase at a mid-twenties percentage rate year-on-year, slightly above consensus forecasts of 22.4%.\n\nShopify's cautious outlook follows similar commentary from Amazon (AMZN), which also forecast second-quarter operating income below estimates, signaling broader pressure across the e-commerce sector.\n\nAccording to a report by The Information on Tuesday, there are \"signs\" that Shopify is pulling back on some of its new loan offers to optimize its financial services amid rising trade risks and a tightening lending environment.\n\nTo keep costs down, CEO Tobi Lutke told employees in a memo last month that they'll have to show that jobs can't be done by artificial intelligence (AI) before asking for more manpower and resources.\n\nShopify's stock has fallen more than 12% year-to-date but has gained 23% over the past 12 months.\n\nFor updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com.<\n\nRead also: Bitcoin Nears $100K For The First Time Since February After Trump Reveals Trade Deal With UK\n\nRead Full Article",

        "title": "Joby's Q1: Key Milestones Achieved as Path to Market Crystalizes",
        "body": "While the financial results reflected the ongoing investments required for a pre-revenue company in this capital-intensive sector, the key takeaways centered on significant operational and certification achievements.\n\nThese strategic wins for the company collectively reinforce Joby's narrative of consistent execution and solidify its perceived leadership position within the eVTOL industry as it progresses towards its target of launching initial passenger services in late 2025 or early 2026.\n\nJoby Aviation's earnings call highlighted that the company has gone from the milestone of a single-piloted eVTOL transition to successfully executing piloted full transition flights on a regular basis, a key operational milestone. This capability, allowing seamless transitions between vertical takeoff, 200 mph cruise flight, and vertical landing with a pilot onboard, is now considered routine.\n\nThree company pilots have completed multiple such flights. CEO JoeBen Bevirt views this achievement as critical for commencing Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) flight testing with FAA pilots, the final step in aircraft certification. Chief Test Pilot James \"Buddy\" Denham reported excellent handling and low pilot workload during these transitions. This success follows extensive prior testing, including over 40,000 miles of flight testing, hundreds of remotely piloted transitions, simulations, and redundancy testing.\n\nJoby also reported significant progress with the FAA-type certification process, marking its second consecutive quarter of record advancement. As of May 5, the company is 43% complete with the FAA side and 62% complete with the Joby side of Stage 4 (Testing & Analysis), representing a 12% point increase from the previous quarter. Stages 1, 2 (Means of Compliance -- essentially complete), and Stage 3 are all complete. This consistent progress through the certification stages is vital for meeting commercial launch targets.\n\nJoby is steadily progressing in its strategy to manufacture eVTOL aircraft at scale. In the first quarter, they powered on their fifth pilot production aircraft in Marina, California, which is undergoing final checks before joining the flight test program as the sixth operational vehicle. The company is continuously improving manufacturing efficiency, evidenced by a 30% reduction in final integration time on the fourth aircraft due to new sub-assembly processes developed with Toyota's support.\n\nExpanding its manufacturing footprint, Joby's larger facility in Marina is expected to be completed in June 2025, more than doubling their existing space. This facility will also include expanded pilot training with a full-motion simulator arriving by year-end 2025, as well as aircraft maintenance capabilities. Concurrently, retrofitting and tooling installation are underway at their larger planned manufacturing site in Ohio, with initial parts production expected soon. Joby is taking a deliberate, phased approach to scaling production, leveraging Toyota's expertise instead of immediately attempting mass production.\n\nJoby Aviation's financial results for the first quarter of 2025 indicate a company focused on future growth through significant investment and determined strategic execution. The net loss improved to $82.4 million (or $0.11 per share) from $94.6 million in Q1 2024. This was mainly due to a larger gain from warrant and earnout share revaluation ($71.0 million vs. $39.0 million).\n\nThe loss from operations increased as operating expenses rose to $163.3 million (from $145.9 million), driven by higher personnel costs, R&D, and prototype part purchases for certification, manufacturing, and testing. Due to these increased expenses, adjusted EBITDA, excluding certain items, showed a wider loss of $127.1 million compared to $110.4 million in the prior year.\n\nDespite the expected elevation in losses as the company moves toward certification, Joby maintains a strong financial position with $812.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. The company also confirmed the finalization of agreements for the initial $250 million tranche of Toyota's $500 million investment, which is expected to be reflected in the second-quarter cash balance. Joby reaffirmed its full-year 2025 cash usage guidance of $500 million to $540 million.\n\nThe earnings call provided details on Joby's go-to-market strategy, which includes three key approaches: direct sales (initially defense-focused with potential expansion), partnership-operated services (primarily international, utilizing local expertise like ANA in Japan), and Joby-operated direct-to-consumer services (the main US model with support from partners like Delta NYSE: DAL and Virgin Atlantic). This multi-faceted strategy aims to balance near-term revenue generation, long-term profitability, and market share growth within the evolving urban air mobility (UAM) sector.\n\nJoby Aviation has appointed Rodrigo Brumana as Chief Financial Officer, effective May 29, 2025, to bolster its executive team as it transitions to commercial operations. Brumana's background includes leadership positions at technology giants such as Amazon NASDAQ: AMZN and others, along with hardware manufacturing experience from Fairchild Semiconductor and Palm. Joby management believes his experience in driving growth and operational efficiency will be critical for scaling manufacturing and preparing for service launch.\n\nKey upcoming milestones for Joby include the commencement of formal TIA flight testing with FAA pilots, following the recent successful piloted transition. The company also plans to deliver an aircraft to Dubai by mid-2025 for hot weather and pilot-on-board testing, supporting its target of launching initial commercial flights in Dubai in late 2025 or early 2026. Further progress on the Ohio manufacturing facility and the finalization of its manufacturing alliance with Toyota, which will release the second investment tranche, are also significant factors for investors to watch.\n\nJoby Aviation's Q1 2025 update confirmed expected operational advancements, notably the routine execution of complex piloted transition flights. This, along with ongoing progress in FAA certification and manufacturing preparation, solidifies the company's disciplined approach to commercialization. Despite typical development-stage net losses, Joby reported a robust cash reserve, anticipated funding from Toyota, and transparent projections for cash utilization and market entry strategies.\n\nAdding a seasoned CFO enhances the leadership team for upcoming scaling efforts. For investors, consistent execution remains paramount. Despite market fluctuations and short interest, Joby's future success and long-term value in the urban air mobility sector hinge on achieving key technical and regulatory milestones, specifically the upcoming TIA flight testing and preparations for the Dubai launch.\n\nBefore you consider Joby Aviation, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

        "body": "[00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, the BLS just announced the unemployment numbers for April, as they always do. The first Friday of the following month, 177 added jobs, unemployment stays at 4.2%.\n\n[00:00:19] Lee Jackson: Yeah.\n\n[00:00:19] Doug McIntyre: Now I was a little surprised it may be that some of the layoffs from the government didn't hit that. My memory is, is that when you look at unemployment, it tends to be weighted the data collection towards the front of the month.\n\n[00:00:39] Lee Jackson: Well, yeah, and maybe they haven't come into it. I'm sure you saw in, in the last week or so, Intel, 20% of the workforce getting laid off UPS 23% of the workforce being laid off because they're kind of opting out of their Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) delivery, which is such a low margin item that they said, we don't need this.\n\n[00:01:02] Lee Jackson: So yeah, it, it, they may have, been able to shake it out this month, but boy, next month could be a total disaster.\n\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. I mean, I've noticed, usually when you start to see guidance disappear, layoffs are the next thing. It's like, okay, you drop guidance and within two or three months, which you figure out as a board of directors is, is well, we should have [00:01:30] guided lower instead of no guidance.\n\n[00:01:31] Doug McIntyre: So,\n\n[00:01:32] Lee Jackson: yeah, I I, and the thing is, they're all faced with this now because. The, the tariffs really didn't start until April 2nd, first quarter. Numbers were already in the can already. And I, I just think that, that it ultimately, it may get solved by the end of the second quarter, but I think there's a lot of trailing layoffs.\n\n[00:01:53] Lee Jackson: They're gonna come in and, for four years, really the numbers were bogus. 'cause all it was was government hiring and government spending. And now that that's going away, it's gonna, at, at one point or another, it's gonna have a big effect. I would think.\n\n[00:02:09] Doug McIntyre: Well, I'm gonna try to think back around three years and say that on average the economy added 175,000 jobs in other, if you just sort of go back and average 'em all together.\n\n[00:02:20] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. Unemployment was down in the, mid threes. Now it's four two. A lot of that has to do with stuff like workforce participation. And there's, I don't think that 4.2 in and of itself, up to three six is a big deal. But I mean, if you said to me that the economy could shed 2 million jobs between now and the end of the year based on tariffs, inflation, guidance, that I think the CEOs, I think know they've decided to guide neutral.\n\n[00:02:56] Doug McIntyre: Like, I don't know. But if you're at, [00:03:00] general Motors and you're Mary Berra and you say, we're pulling our guidance, the answer to that is, is that if their tariffs are on our automobiles and we are charging $6,000 more per car, we're not gonna stay fully staffed based on where we are right now.\n\n[00:03:15] Lee Jackson: No, hardly no.\n\n[00:03:17] Lee Jackson: And I, I think it's, it is almost we're, we're getting close to the end of a cycle, not the beginning. And so, near the end of that, that is when you do see layoffs and you do see. But I mean, Intel and UPS have nothing to do with tariffs. Nothing. it's all based on Intel is just a, fraction of a shell of what it used to be.\n\n[00:03:37] Lee Jackson: And UPS just doesn't make as much money with that low margin Amazon business. It's hardcore business decisions.\n\n[00:03:45] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. So I see corporate margins coming down just in, across industries. I see, layoffs that, could get into the six figures per month. And then to me, you look at the economy and say, what else is going on?\n\n[00:04:02] Doug McIntyre: Because of the way the Fed looks at the economy now, mortgage rates are still at very close to 7%. Yeah. So you're, you're not looking at a lot of movement in the housing market. You're gonna look at higher prices on cars, but you know, a car loan is six or 7% right now. So there are these colliding movements of things that are bad for the economy.\n\n[00:04:24] Doug McIntyre: Look, everybody, all the economists tariffs are attacks. Yes, tariffs are [00:04:30] everybody please repeat after me. Tariffs are attacks ostensibly.\n\n[00:04:37] Doug McIntyre: Last thing I saw from an economist, which was yesterday in the Wall Street Journal, typical family could add $3,800 to its expenses based on the, the tariff math it is today.\n\n[00:05:05] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. Median household income in the United States right now is less than 80,000 by a fraction. So do the math. You've got an $80,000 household, you've gotta find an extra six K.\n\n[00:05:20] Doug McIntyre: You're probably living paycheck to paycheck. Yeah, maybe a lot better. Yeah. Now you're gonna throw this on top of people, and to me the next word is the big D defaults. you're already starting to see default levels on credit card cards moving up. To me,\n\n[00:05:36] Lee Jackson: credit cards are maxed out. car payments are becoming more and more delinquent.\n\n[00:05:43] Lee Jackson: I mean, it is adding up. I have a very good friend who you're probably familiar with her name is Danielle DeMartino Booth. Are you familiar with her? Yeah. And I've known Danielle for 25 years, when I met her, when she was a columnist for the Dallas Morning News. And she's [00:06:00] one person that if you go through her data, she is very, very bearish on the near term future.\n\n[00:06:07] Lee Jackson: we can work through it, but she says most of the, and she was at the Fed for like 10 years in Dallas and she knows that a lot of this is just smoke and mirrors.\n\n[00:06:17] Doug McIntyre: The other thing that I don't like, and I'm, I'm looking through the numbers right now. I don't like the number of people who are, what they call long-term unemployed.\n\n[00:06:28] Doug McIntyre: the people who've been looking for jobs for over 27 weeks, that number is high. It went up by 179,000. That's, to me, the number of people who are looking for jobs, they're currently part-time, they'd like full-time jobs. That's over a hundred thousand. Inside these, if you don't read all the fine print, like wages, long term unemployed, part term, looking for full term, you don't get a full picture of this.\n\n[00:07:01] Doug McIntyre: This is not a classic 4.2 add on, 1 77. I agree. This is footnote, footnote, footnote, footnote. And.\n\n[00:07:13] Doug McIntyre: I'm looking at 6% unemployment before the end of the year. Oh, my number is 6%. if nothing happens with tariffs, if there's no solid negotiations between now and [00:07:30] mid-year, my number's higher than that. My numbers,\n\n[00:07:34] Lee Jackson: my number. Let's, let's do this. Why don't we circle back in about a month when the may numbers come out in early June?\n\n[00:07:42] Lee Jackson: 'cause we'll be, on he precipice of finishing up the, the quarter and the half and see if it skews up in early June.",
